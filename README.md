# **This script no longer works as now 4chan serves javascript challenges**

# 4chan image scraper
made in python + shell because python is dumb and complicated 

# usage
run downloader.sh.
it takes 2 arguments, first one being the directory where you wanna save your stuff and the second one being the thread link
# interactive mode
just run download.sh without any arguments and it will prompt you for the directory and thread link
# dependencies
this depends on python's BeautifulSoup for scraping and wget for downloading

To-do: change from wget to curl
